Just testing out my new [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) blog app. It took me about 2 hours to get this blog up and running on one of my current droplets in [Digital Ocean](http://digitalocean.com). It was a fun process. I can write in my text editor using *markdown* and then push my changes to the server with *git*. The server then compiles and creates a static version of the website.

Now comes the fun part of actually creating my new blog. The ideia with this is to have a place to write down my notes and adventures about programming, design and startups.

Currently i'm working on [Avalanche Network](http://avalanche.network), a plataform for crowdsourcing task lists.

I have been doing a lot of cool experiments for __Avalanche__ that need to be shared with the world.

In the past few weeks I played around with some realy cool javscript frameworks like [Famo.us](http://famo.us), [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com) and [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/). On the server side, I have been experimenting with realtime messaging with web sockets using [Faye](http://faye.jcoglan.com/) and I'm also creating a  API with [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/).

Besides programming, i have some other cool jobs going on like the project for the new [Endossa](http://endossa.com) store's front facade and the __Flux 324__ opening and closing credits animation.
