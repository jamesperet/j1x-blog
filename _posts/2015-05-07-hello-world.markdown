Just testing out my new blog plattaform. It took me about 2 hours to get this blog up and running a one of my current droplets in [Digital Ocean](http://digitalocean.com). It was a fun process.

Now comes the fun part of actually creating my new blog. The ideia with this is to create a place where i can actually write down my notes about programming and startups.

Currently i'm working on [Avalanche Network](http://avalanche.network), a plataform for crowdsourcing task lists.
