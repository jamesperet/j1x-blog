## Droplet Setup

This server is going to have a bit of load so I will use the *$10* droplet with **1GB Ram** and **30GB SSD Disk**. Use the **Ubuntu 14.04 x64** image. I choose *Ubuntu* because there is a lot of documentation for it, but probably *Debian* or *CentOS* would be a better choise as a linux distro for a web server.
