Every time I upgrade the Mac OSX software, my windows bootcamp installation breaks. This is very annoying and makes me loose a lot of time having to figure out how to install bootcamp with the new OSX version. And it looks like each version has its own quirks to install.

This time i'm going to try something different. Instead of just installing windows thru bootcamp and next time the EFI Firmware changes, windows just breaks, this time i'm going to install a different EFI firmware.

## Creating the Windows USB installer
